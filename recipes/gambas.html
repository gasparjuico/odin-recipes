    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A shrimp is a crustacean with an elongated body and a primarily swimming mode of locomotion typically belonging to the Caridea or Dendrobranchiata of the decapod order, although some crustaceans outside of this order are also referred to as "shrimp".</p>

        <li>1 teaspoon hot smoked paprika (Optional)</li>
        <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dry sherry</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped Italian flat-leaf parsley</li>
